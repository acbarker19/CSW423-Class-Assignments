# CSW423 Class Assignments
 A repository containing multiple small projects created in my fourth web design class (CSW423: Interaction Design) as the University of Mount Union.

Some code is supplied by open source website templates found on the internet and modified by Alec Barker.

It contains webpages that use the following elements:
- Multiple Examples of Designing a Web Form
- Building a Simple Website from an Online Template
- Using CSS Animations
- Using CSS to Create a Responsive Website
- Building a Prototype Website from an Online Template
