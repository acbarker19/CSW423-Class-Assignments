				<h4> Johnny Cash </h4>
				<p> Johnny Cash (born J.R. Cash, February 26, 1932 â€“ September 12, 2003) was an American singer-songwriter,
					guitarist, actor, and author. He is one of the
					best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 90 million records worldwide.
					Although primarily remembered as a country music icon, his genre-spanning songs and sound embraced
					rock and roll, rockabilly, blues, folk, and gospel. This crossover appeal won Cash the rare honor of
					being inducted into the Country Music, Rock and Roll, and Gospel Music Halls of Fame. Cash was known
					for his deep, calm bass-baritone voice, the distinctive sound of his Tennessee Three backing band
					characterized by train-sound guitar rhythms, a rebelliousness coupled with an increasingly somber
					and humble demeanor, free prison concerts, and a trademark, all-black stage wardrobe, which
					earned him the nickname "The Man in Black." He traditionally began his concerts by simply
					introducing himself, "Hello, I'm Johnny Cash," followed by his signature song "Folsom Prison
					Blues". Much of Cash's music contained themes of sorrow, moral tribulation, and redemption,
					especially in the later stages of his career. His other signature songs include "I Walk the
					Line", "Ring of Fire", "Get Rhythm", and "Man in Black". He also recorded humorous numbers like "One
					Piece at a Time" and "A Boy Named Sue"; a duet with his future wife, June Carter, called "Jackson"
					(followed by many further duets after their wedding); and railroad songs including "Hey, Porter",
					"Orange Blossom Special", and "Rock Island Line". During the last stage of his career, Cash covered
					songs by several late 20th-century rock artists, notably "Hurt" by Nine Inch Nails and "Rusty Cage" by
					Soundgarden.
